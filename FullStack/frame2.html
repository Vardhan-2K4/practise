    <h2>About HTML Frames</h2>
    <p>
        HTML Frames allow you to divide the browser window into multiple rectangular regions, with each region displaying a different HTML document.
        This technique was popular in the early days of the web but has since been deprecated due to various issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Issues include poor accessibility, difficulties with bookmarking specific content, challenges with printing, and SEO disadvantages.
        Modern web design relies on CSS for layout (e.g., Flexbox, CSS Grid) and JavaScript for dynamic content inclusion.
